APPENDIX F: BROADBAND RADIO SPECTRA FOR G4JY–3CRR SOURCES

As part of our comparison with the 3CRR sample (section 7.3 of Paper I), we plot summed, GLEAM integrated flux-densities 
alongside measurements obtained for 3CR sources, spanning 10 MHz to 15 GHz (Laing & Peacock, 1980). We thank Robert Laing 
for providing a compilation of the latter. Note that this does not include data for the following sources: G4Jy 18 
(4C +12.03), G4Jy 432 (4C +14.11), G4Jy 714 (4C +14.27), G4Jy 1004 (1227+119), G4Jy 1282 (3C 326), G4Jy 1419 (4C +16.49), 
and G4Jy 1456 (4C +13.66). This is because these sources were added later, during the creation of the 3CRR sample (Laing 
et al., 1983), or – in the case of 3C 326 – the source was omitted by Laing & Peacock (1980) because its ‘integrated flux 
densities are not well known’. These spectra are available online as supplementary material through PASA, but we also 
provide them here (https://github.com/svw26/G4Jy/tree/master/G4Jy_PaperI_AppendixF).

FIGURE CAPTION: Broadband radio data for G4Jy sources that also appear in the 3CRR sample (section 7.3 and appendix F of 
Paper I). Red datapoints are total, integrated flux-densities from GLEAM (section 6.5 of Paper I), and blue datapoints 
are flux densities from Laing & Peacock (1980). Fitted to all data is a power-law function (orange, solid line) and a 
curved model (black, dashed line; Callingham et al., 2017) to guide the eye. Note that the curved fit is largely being 
dominated by small uncertainties associated with the high-frequency data, and that sudden ‘up-turns’ in the GLEAM flux-
densities are likely due to the calibration failing for particular sub-bands.
