# G4Jy

This is a repository for things related to the GLEAM 4-Jy Sample: https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01226.

This sample is a collation of the brightest radio-sources across the southern sky (Dec. < 30 deg), which have an integrated flux-density of > 4 Jy at 151 MHz (as measured in the GLEAM extragalactic catalogue -- https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08318). 

Once the paper is accepted, I will provide:
* A link to the catalogue
* A link to a server, which will distribute cutouts and overlays created for this sample
* A python to script to aid the download of cutouts/overlays from the server

Stay tuned.
